# Task 8.1 Prioritization Rubric (Post-Pilot)

Use this rubric to decide what to build next after collecting pilot feedback.

## Scoring dimensions (0-3 each)

1. **Learning impact**
   - 0: minimal effect on student understanding
   - 3: major improvement in core concepts

2. **Contributor pipeline impact**
   - 0: no effect on contributor readiness
   - 3: directly improves readiness for Core-oriented testing work

3. **Implementation effort**
   - 0: heavy effort / unclear scope
   - 3: small, clear, fast to deliver

4. **Evidence value (grant/report)**
   - 0: weak external storytelling value
   - 3: strong, concrete value signal

5. **Reusability**
   - 0: one-off fix
   - 3: reusable across future cohorts/tasks

## Priority score

`Priority = Learning + Pipeline + Effort + Evidence + Reusability` (max 15)

## Decision thresholds

- 12-15: do next sprint
- 9-11: schedule soon
- 6-8: backlog
- 0-5: deprioritize unless blocking issue

## Tie-breakers

When scores tie, prefer items that:

1. reduce setup or interpretation friction,
2. create reusable templates,
3. strengthen cross-instance reproducibility evidence.
